								<h4 class="alt">I'm currently a PhD candidate at the Florida Museum of Natural History and Biolog Department at the University of Florida.
									My research works to combine ecological and evolutionary knowledge with burgeoning data resources and computational tools to answer 
									pressing questions of how global change is impacting biodiversity. I am particularily interested in using citizen science data 
									and ecological traits to explore what species may fare better given continued climate change and land-use change.

									Insect phenological lability is a key strategy for species to adapt under environmental change.
								        Although, studies have found insects are in general are advancing the start of their activity periods
									earlier, much remains unknown across greater spatial, temporal, and taxonomic extents, especially in 
									relation to when adult insect activity terminates and activity duration. 
									<a href="pdfs/EcologyLetters-2021-Belitz"> I've used community-science and museum specimen data to 
									investigate how adult insect phenology varies spatially in response to climate and 
									urbanization</a>, and how such responses differ across species-specific life history traits. We found detritivores
								        and species with aquatic larval stages extend activity periods the most in response to increasing regional temperature.
								       Conversely, species with underground larval stages have relatively constant durations regardless of temperature.

								<p> Unstructured ecological data are rapidly becoming available from citizen science endeavors such as 
								iNaturalist and through digitization efforts of museum specimen. These data promise to increase the 
								scales at which research can occur, but this assumes reliable quantitative methods exist to deal with
								known and unknown biases in these data. I am deeply interested in developing 
								<a href="pdfs/MEE-2020-Belitz"> methods</a>,and <a href="pdfs/APPS-2020-Barve"> pipelines</a>,
							        to enhance the research being done with these unstructured data. <p>

								<p> Urbanization is an agent of ecological and evolutionary changes that can not only lead 
									to biodiversity loss but can also alter the seasonal timing of events. Insect phenology may 
										be particularly sensitive to urban heat island effects given that the developmental 
								timing of insects are temperature-dependent. However, insect phenology response to urbanization remains unclear, 
									with some studies demonstrating advancing phenology in urban areas, while other studies detecting no shifts. 
							We collected macro-moths using light traps for 52 consecutive weeks at sites along an urban-to-rural gradient in Alachua County
							Florida to examine the effects of urbanization on a well studied group of organisms.Our preliminary results provide no 
								evidence that urbanization is shifting the peak timing of when moths are flying in aggregate. However, we do detect 
									heterogeneity in species-specific responses and expect these responses to be related to certain life-history traits.
										We are in the process of gathering life history traits and will use a phylogenetically controlled mixed-modeling 
									approach to fully test our trait-based hypotheses. 
								This work will provide a framework to further our understanding of how insect species will respond phenologically to urbanization. <p>

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>I'm a global change biologist with broad interests that span the fields of ecology, evolution,
								data science, conservation biology, ecological modeling, and informatics. My PhD will be in Zoology
							from the biology department of the University of Florida, where I have worked with Dr. Robert Guralnick in the 
							Florida Museum of Natural History. Previously, I've worked on historical distribution modeling and field surveys 
							to inform the conservation of the critically endangered Poweshiek skipperling as part of my Master's work at
							Central Michigan University with Dr. Anna Monfils. </p>
							
							<p> When I'm not collecting, cleaning, or analyzing ecological data, I like spending my time backcountry 
								camping, contributing to citizen science datasets via iNaturalist and eBird, and playing beach volleyball.<p>
