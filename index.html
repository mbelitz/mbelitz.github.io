							</header>
												  <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/netHolding.jpg" alt="" /></a>


							<p> I am a global change biologist interested in combining data-science and field approaches to understand how ecological communities respond to anthropogenic change. Currently, I'm an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow, co-mentored by the <a href = "https://zipkinlab.org/"> Zipkin Quantitative Ecology Lab</a> and <a href = "https://www.marshall-lab.com/"> the Marshall Lab</a>. I received my PhD at the University Florida and the Florida Museum of Natural History working <a href = "https://www.gurlab.net/"> Rob Guralnick</a>, curator of biodiversity informatics. I also earned a MS at Central Michigan University, where I've worked with Anna Monfils on historical distribution modeling and field surveys to inform the conservation of the critically endangered Poweshiek skipperling. My research combines ecological and evolutionary theory with burgeoning data resources and computational tools to answer pressing questions of how global environmental change, such as urbanization, agricultural intensification, and climate change is impacting biodiversity. I am particularily interested in using participatory science data, museum collections, and ecological traits to explore what species and locations may fare better given continued climate and land-use change. To date, I have worked primarily with insects and plants, but I have broad taxonomic interests.

											<h4>Study area of a phenological study</h4>

									</article>
										<p> 
									Shifts in phenology are among the most notable impacts of human-caused climate change. Although, studies have found insects are in general are advancing the start of their activity periods earlier, much remains unknown across greater spatial, temporal, and taxonomic extents. 
									In one <a href="pdfs/2021/EcologyLetters-2021-Belitz.pdf"> paper</a>, I've used community-science and museum specimen data to 
									investigate how adult insect phenology varies spatially in response to climate and 
									urbanization, and how such responses differ across species-specific life history traits at a continental scale. I've also written a <a href="pdfs/2023/FunctionalEcology-2023-Belitz.pdf"> paper</a> on the best practices of using natural history collection data in phenological research.

								<p> Unstructured ecological data are rapidly becoming available from citizen science endeavors such as 
								iNaturalist and through digitization efforts of museum specimen. These data promise to increase the 
								scales at which research can occur, but this assumes reliable quantitative methods exist to deal with
								known and unknown biases in these data. I am passionate about developing 
								<a href="pdfs/2020/MEE-2020-Belitz.pdf"> methods</a> and <a href="pdfs/2020/APPS-2020-Barve.pdf"> pipelines</a> to enhance applications of unstructured data. As part of a large collaborative team, I am mapping the distribution of all dragonfly and damselfly species. To date, we have published papers on the diversity of Odonata in the <a href="pdfs/2022/Diversity-2022-Abott.pdf"> Nearctic </a> and <a href="pdfs/2022/Diversity-2022-Kalkmann.pdf"> Palaearctic</a> realms. <p>

											<h4>Response of macro-moths to urbanization</h4>
										</header>
										
											
								<p> Urbanization is an agent of ecological and evolutionary changes that can not only lead 
									to biodiversity loss but can also alter the seasonal timing of events. Insects may 
										be particularly sensitive to urbanization given that their development is temperature-dependent. However, how insects respond to urbanization remains unclear, especially in urban areas and across multiple life-stages. In my PhD, I collected data using frass traps and light traps along an urban-to-rural gradient in Alachua County	Florida to examine the effects of urbanization moths. I have <a href="pdfs/2024/GCB-2024-Belitz.pdf"> published work</a> documenting the far-reaching consequences of urbanization on moth communities. <p>

											<h4>Likelihood an observation reaches research-grade on iNaturalist</h4>

								<p> Harnessing the power of community science will involve ecological modelers to 
								recognize and address biases that occur in these datasets. I have worked on teams
								to <a href="pdfs/BioSci-2020_DiCecco.pdf"> examine the biases occcurring in iNaturalist datasets</a>,
								and I have also collaborated on projects exploring how the <a href="pdfs/Ecography-2021-Shirey.pdf"> completeness of butterfly inventories </a>                 vary spatially and temporally for community science and museum specimen records. Recently, we've examined how <a href="pdfs/2023/BioSci-2023-Campbell.pdf"> identifiers on iNaturalist support data generation</a> <p>
